# Mobilot

Mobilot presents an intuitive system for easily creating and consuming content-centric content: _seekoi_. It can be used for various applications and is intended to enable this for all Internet users.

### About

In previous projects, a functional prototype has already been developed, which includes the position as a shortcut. Nevertheless, smartphones offer more context-relevant information, such as the current GPS position, the current speed or proximity to (moving) objects.

The prototype has already been used for educational purposes in the classroom and in forest pedagogic. It has, however, repeatedly turned out that an even simpler operation is of great importance. Using _seekoi_ we want to develop on top of the acquired experience, a productive system and integrate further contexts. The system should be usable by not only by programmers, but everyone. The more complex the possibilities, the more confusing the UI becomes. We want to address and counteract this issue with help of this project.
